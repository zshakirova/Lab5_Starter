Answers to the Unit Testing with Jest
1. It depends on the complexity of the "message" function. If the feature is complex and involves many interactions or dependencies, unit testing may not be good option. This is because unit tests are best suited for testing isolated, small pieces of code. But we can still use unit tests to test individual functionality in the message function.

2. Yes, I can use a unit test to test the "max message length" function. This function is a good candidate for unit testing because it is a discrete, isolated function that can be easily tested in isolation. This type of unit test is simple and can be completed quickly, providing immediate feedback during development.
